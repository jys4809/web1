<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
  <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.Web browsers
  receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render
  them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
  the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
   the appearance of the document.</p>
<p style="margin-top:200px;margin-left:20px">HTML elements are the    building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the
 rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
 structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,
  quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using
   angle brackets.</p>
